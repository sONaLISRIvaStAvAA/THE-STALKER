# THE STALKER ðŸ‘€  

### Object Detection System with Twinkle Twinkle Melody  

**THE STALKER** is an ultrasonic object detection system that **"stalks"** its surroundings and triggers an alert when an object is detected within a **10cm range**. Upon detection, the system **plays the â€˜Twinkle Twinkleâ€™ melody** as a response.  

---

## ðŸš€ Features  
- **Ultrasonic Object Detection**: Uses an **HC-SR04** sensor to measure distance.  
- **Musical Alert**: Plays **Twinkle Twinkle** when an object is within range.  
- **Arduino-Based**: Programmed using Arduino IDE for real-time detection.  
- **Hands-on Learning**: Explores sensor interfacing, circuit design, and debugging.

## ðŸ”§ Components Used  
âœ” **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)** â€“ Measures distance to objects.  
âœ” **Arduino (Uno/Nano/etc.)** â€“ Processes sensor data and controls output.  
âœ” **Buzzer/Speaker** â€“ Plays the musical note.  
âœ” **Resistors & Jumper Wires** â€“ For circuit connections.  
âœ” **Power Source (Battery/USB)** â€“ Powers the system.

## ðŸ›  How It Works  
1. The **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** continuously scans for nearby objects.  
2. If an object is detected **within 10cm**, the Arduino triggers the **buzzer**.  
3. The buzzer plays the **Twinkle Twinkle melody** as a response.  
4. If the object moves out of range, the system resets and continues monitoring.

## âš  Challenges Faced  
- **COM5 Error in Arduino** â€“ Took time to troubleshoot connectivity issues.  
- **Wiring & Connection Errors** â€“ Debugging loose or incorrect connections.  
- **Code Logic Adjustments** â€“ Tweaked and tested to ensure accurate detection.  

Despite these hurdles, **THE STALKER is now fully functional!** ðŸš€
